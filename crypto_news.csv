XRP Bulls On The Horizon: Could A Breakout Push Prices Above $0.6?,1694084441,newsbtc,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/xrp-bulls-on-the-horizon-could-a-breakout-push-prices-above-0-6/,"XRP has been navigating turbulent waters in recent months. After reaching a high of $0.936, the coin took a nosedive to hit the $0.5 mark, leaving investors in a state of uncertainty. With a current price of $0.502574 according to CoinGecko, XRP is experiencing a minor 0.3% decline in the last 24 hours, contributing to a seven-day slump of 4.8%. However, a recent price report has sparked hope among XRP enthusiasts, suggesting a potential rebound that could change the game for this digital asset. The report indicates that a potential rebound from the current bottom could serve as a catalyst for bullish momentum. If the crypto manages to break above the critical resistance level at $0.556, it is expected to ignite a surge in buying pressure, possibly driving the price up to $0.665. This price movement could rejuvenate investor sentiment and restore confidence in XRP as a viable investment option. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Maze: Will It Soar To $2,000 Or Stay At $1,500 In September? Caution In A Downtrend For XRP Holders Despite the optimistic outlook, the report also offers a word of caution. In established downtrends, assets tend to undergo short consolidations to recover from exhausted bearish momentum before continuing their downward trajectory. For the Ripple native currency, this means that it may breach the $0.486 support level, potentially leading to a 13% drop to reach $0.42. Investors should remain vigilant and consider both the potential for a rebound and the risks associated with a further decline. XRP market cap currently at $26 billion. Chart: TradingView.com Bybit Launches XRP/EUR Trading Pair In the midst of these price fluctuations, major cryptocurrency exchange Bybit has introduced a new trading pair that has caught the attention of XRP enthusiasts. The exchange recently launched the XRP/EUR trading pair, expanding its offerings for traders seeking exposure to the digital currency.

The cryptocurrency’s ability to rebound and reclaim lost ground remains to be seen, but one thing is certain: the XRP community remains resilient and optimistic in the face of adversity.

Power strategy: How bitcoin miner Riot benefits from energy credits,1694078023,seekingalpha,https://seekingalpha.com/news/4009768-power-strategy-bitcoin-miner-riot-platforms-energy-credits?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=news,"Riot Platforms ( NASDAQ: RIOT ), which has been losing money due to less-profitable mining and soaring energy prices, is now relying on credits earned by curtailing its power consumption during peak demand in Texas. The second largest bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) miner in terms of market capitalization earned $31.7M in credits from Texas power grid operator ERCOT in August, surpassing the total credits received in 2022. In Q2, it'd earned $13.5M in power credits. During the record-breaking heatwave in August, Riot ( RIOT ) voluntarily curtailed its power use by over 95% and sold power back to the Texas grid through its fixed low-price contracts. The credits, which significantly lower Riot's ( RIOT ) cost to mine, equated to ~1,136 BTC. That's much higher than its bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) production in August, when it mined 333 BTC, an 18.8% drop from July's tally. It is becoming increasingly less profitable to mine bitcoin ( BTC-USD ), given lower BTC prices and higher network hash rate deteriorating margins. ""Riot's power strategy is a key competitive advantage, and when placed alongside our strong financial position and efficient miner fleet, put Riot in a leading position heading into the upcoming bitcoin 'halving' event next year,"" said CEO Jason Les. Most BTC miners have been operating at lower uptimes due to the summer heat, although Jefferies' Jonathan Petersen expects this will moderate soon. Riot ( RIOT ) more than tripled in value YTD as bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) rebounded this year from 2022 lows, but the stock is still well below the $79.50 peak seen in 2021.
